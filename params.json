{"name":"Drupal-ios-sdk","body":"Drupal iOS SDK - Connect your iOS/OS X app to Drupal\r\n================================\r\nWhat you need to know\r\n================================\r\nThe Drupal iOS SDK is a standard set of libraries for communicating to Drupal from any iOS device. Its extremely simple.\r\nIf you wanted to get a node you can do so by instantiating a DIOSNode Object, creating an \r\nNSDictionairy and running the nodeGet method.  Heres an example:\r\n\r\n```obj-c\r\n    DIOSNode *node = [[DIOSNode alloc] init];\r\n    NSMutableDictionary *nodeData = [NSMutableDictionary new];\r\n    [nodeData setValue:@\"12\" forKey:@\"nid\"];\r\n    [node nodeGet:nodeData success:^(AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation, id responseObject) {\r\n      //Do Something with the responseObject\r\n      NSLog(@\"%@\", responseObject);\r\n    } failure:^(AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation, NSError *error) {\r\n      //we failed, uh-oh lets error log this.\r\n      NSLog(@\"%@,  %@\", [error localizedDescription], [operation responseString]);    \r\n    }];\r\n    \r\n```\r\nFor every DIOS Object you make, any method calls that are available to you use blocks. \r\nThis allows us to define what happens when we have a request that fails or succeeds. \r\nIf the request was successful the result would be something like this:\r\n\r\n    {\"vid\":\"9\",\"uid\":\"57\",\"title\":\"testtitle\",\"log\":\"\",\"status\":\"1\".......\r\n    \r\nHowever if it failed, the error might look like this:\r\n\r\n    Expected status code in (200-299), got 404,  \"Node 5 could not be found\"\r\n    \r\nWhat you need to get started\r\n================================\r\n* This library :) \r\n* AFNetwork which can be found [here](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking)\r\n* Be sure to follow the AFNetworking installation guide.\r\n* Update Settings.h with the correct correct url and endpoints)\r\n* [Services](http://github.com/kylebrowning/services)\r\n\r\nDemo App (Work in progress)\r\n--------------------\r\n[http://github.com/workhabitinc/drupal-ios-sdk-example](http://github.com/workhabitinc/drupal-ios-sdk-example)\r\n\r\nBranches\r\n--------------------\r\n6.x-2.x 6.x-3.x and 7.x-3.x have all been moved to a  *DEPRECATED* version of their branch.\r\nThe new dev branch will be the become the new master and as things are added, versions will be tagged and published.\r\nmaster will always be the latest and greatest for the most up to date version of everything(Services, Drupal, Services Api, DIOS).\r\n\r\nTags are in this format\r\n`2.1-1.0` Which breaks down as, DIOSVersion 2.1, Services Api Version 1.0\r\n\r\nBranches are in this format\r\n`2.x-1.x`\r\n\r\nOAuth\r\n--------------------\r\nits coming.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-----------\r\n[Can be found here](https://github.com/workhabitinc/drupal-ios-sdk/wiki/drupal-ios-sdk-2.0)\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting\r\n----------\r\nIf you are getting Access denied, or API Key not valid, double check that your key settings are setup correctly at admin/build/services/keys and double check that permissions are correct for your user and anonymous.\r\n\r\nX service doesnt exist in Drupal iOS SDK\r\n----------\r\nYou no longer really need to subclass any existing DIOS classes, unless you want to override.\r\n`[DIOSSession shared]` ensures that session information is stored for as long as the cookies are valid\r\nIf you do want to make your own object, just follow the pattern in the other files and everything should work fine.\r\nUse the issue queue here on github if you have questions.\r\n\r\nQuestions\r\n----------\r\nCheckout the Issue queue, or email me\r\nEmail kyle@workhabit.com","tagline":"The Drupal iOS iPhone & iPad Software Development Kit provides a full suite of iOS features to natively connect iOS applications to Drupal.
